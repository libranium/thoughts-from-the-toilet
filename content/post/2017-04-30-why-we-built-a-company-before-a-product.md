For the love of trees.

People are often surprised to learn that bonsai is an outdoor art. I was surprised by my own surprise when I learned the same. “People got this idea in their heads that bonsai trees are indoor trees, and yeah, trees hate that.” Said the Australian man in a rainbow knit hat on his bonsai YouTube video for beginners interested in bonsai. It was a “this is water” moment. As in, a fish passes two younger fish and says, “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” The younger fish share a confused look and ask each other, “What the hell is water?” A variant of the fish who was looking for the ocean in _Soul_. Anyway, trees like to be outside, don’tch ya know? I watched and read and read and read and learned more and more.

The art of bonsai originated in the Chinese empire before making its way to Japan. Bon-sai, pronounced bone-sai, and meaning “planted in a container,” should be distinguished from the phrase “banzai,” meaning “10 thousand years” and which was the last phrase shouted by some Japanese soldiers during the second World War. A bonsai tree is one which is planted in a container. Buddhist monks developed elaborate potted landscapes to represent different physical locations, or in a single tree—the universe. It is an art of time and continuous care. I like it. I enjoy watching incremental changes shape a life. I like seeing the results of struggle and trauma on the trunk and their corresponding influence on the overall shape of the tree. I like how some trees continue to grow after their trunk has collapsed in on itself. The Zen monks were right; a tree can represent the universe.

Bonsai at the Potter's Stall

BY KAY MULLEN

Under fluorescent light,

aligned on a bench

and table top, oranges

the size of marbles dangle

from trees with glossy

leaves. White trumpets

bloom in tiny clay pots.

Under a firethorn’s twisted

limbs, a three inch monk

holds a cup from which

he appears to drink

the interior life. The potter

prizes his bonsai children

who will never grow up,

never leave home.
